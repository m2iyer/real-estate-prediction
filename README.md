## Real Estate Market Analysis

![Image_2 in assets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m2iyer/real-estate-prediction/read-me-project-desc/assets/For%20Sale%20Real%20Estate%20Postcard.png)

Using real estate data with over 10000 data points, 28 influencing vectors and multiple modelling techniques, we analyze the housing market of Washington D.C. The techniques used are Linear Regression, Smoothing, Random Forests and Gradient Boosting accompanied by a Final Report to analyze key findings from the data and evaluate the process of selecting the "best" model.


We use R to visually understand the real estate variates and the influence it has on the models. Our focus as a class was primarily on obtaining the best _RMSLE score_ against the
test data on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/stat444-20-lm) . 

## Report preview

In the Final Report, I highlight the key insights and shortcomings of each of the models with the dataset and the criteria that played an important role in choosing the "best" model to predict the house prices in Washington D.C. When choosing a model, make sure to also understand the practicalities of the data and the nuances in prediction metrics like _RMSLE, RMSE, MAE, etc_ . Enjoy!

## Usage

The _house-train_ and _house-test_ files are the training and test data for all the models. Since each of the models use a variety of libraries like _mgcv, DT, mice, knitr, ggcorrplot, etc_ in R make sure to install their corresponding packages and dependencies before you get started! I would love to know if you have any concerns/questions :)
